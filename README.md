This project was made to showcase a sample example of muli-threading in the C programming language. To be more exact, in this project we'll be trying to approximate the value pi. 

## Methodology

We'll be utilizing the function $\dfrac{4}{1 + x^2}$, the integral of which is a near approximation of $\pi$. Thus we'll be calculating the following formula:

$$
\int \dfrac{4}{1 + x^2} \, dx= \pi
$$

There is of course a minor issue with this calculation.
